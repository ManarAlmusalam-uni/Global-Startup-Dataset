# Global-Startup-Dataset
This dataset provides a comprehensive view of global startups across multiple industries.

The goal of this project is to use the Global Startup Dataset to predict the future outcome of a new company. Because most startups fail in their first few years, I am building a classification model that can look at a company's initial data—such as where it is located and how much money it made in its first year—and categorize it as either a 'Success' or a 'Failure.' This helps investors understand which patterns lead to growth and which ones are warning signs of a business closing down.
